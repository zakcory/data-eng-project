IDEA FOR THE LAB PROJECT  ----------------------- ACTIVE LEARNING WITH GNN

(we will use images and CNNs but technically can be applied to any type of data)



MAIN IDEA: after training the model with the initial label set, build a graph that contains info about similarities between the pictures and use GNN to propagate the labels



1. train with the seed set
2. use the penultimate layer of the GNN to extract features
3. use the features to make a similarity matrix (if too large, build an index)
4. build a graph according to the similarities (10-15 NN)
5. train the GNN (use only the seed set for training), propagate the labels
6. after that, propagate the labels

7. now, we have the graph to measure the uncertainty as well!
we can look at the furthest nodes from the labelled ones (unexplored nodes)
weigh ----------------> (1 - alpha) * uncertainty + (alpha * distance-based metric)

8. add new nodes to the seed and retrain or fine-tune the model
